# BigQuery Business Analytics Project
This project demonstrates how Google BigQuery can be used to answer key business questions using real-world transactional data. The analysis uncovers customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends through structured queries and data aggregation.

## üîç Project Objective
To extract actionable insights from sales, customer, and product data using SQL queries in Google BigQuery. This analysis answers 9 core business questions relevant to decision-making in e-commerce or retail environments.

## üìä Dataset Overview
The dataset contains three main tables:
- `CUSTOMER`: Contains customer ID, name, gender, location, etc.
- `PRODUCT`: Contains product ID, name, category, and price.
- `TRANSACTION`: Contains transaction details, including date, product purchased, customer ID, payment method, and total price.

## ‚ùì 9 Business Questions Answered

5. **What is the average value of transactions for each customer?**
6. **What are the monthly sales trends for each product?**
7. **Which payment methods are most commonly used?**
8. **Who are the top 10 customers by total spending?**
9. **How many transactions occurred each day?**
